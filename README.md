# ♻️ AI-Based Smart Waste Classification System (Simulation)

This project is a simulated AI-powered Smart Waste Segregator system built using Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow. It classifies images of waste as **Paper** or **Plastic** and identifies **hazardous waste (Plastic)** requiring **instant chemical clearance**. The system displays predictions visually and simulates motor actions for sorting waste types.



 📌 Features

- 🧠 Real AI model (`.h5`) used for prediction  
- 📸 Image classification using Raspberry Pi-style simulation  
- 🧪 Terminal and on-image messages for:
  - Waste type (Paper or Plastic)
  - Hazard warnings for non-degradable waste
  - Suggested action (Chemical Clearance / Not Required)
- 🖼️ Enlarged image preview with overlaid prediction and instructions
- 🚫 No hardware required — fully simulated environment


🔍 What This Project Proves

- You can simulate an AI-powered waste segregation system without needing physical hardware.
- AI can be trained to distinguish between recyclable and non-recyclable waste.
- Visual and textual feedback adds an interactive experience.
- A unique innovation: **flagging hazardous waste (Plastic)** and suggesting **automated chemical clearance** to support eco-sustainability.
